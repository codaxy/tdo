# tdo


Tdo is a minimalist hackable to do list, suited for handling a wide range of tasks.
Other task managment apps are good, but we wanted to declutter the interface and keep it productive

For this reason it is built as simple as possible, yet allows deep customization via CSS and Markdown. 


[Open](https://tdo.cxjs.io) tdo,

[install](https://github.com/codaxy/tdo/releases/tag/1.0.0) it for Windows,

Or get it for android by visiting it through Chrome and click 'add to your homescreen'.


## Install & Run

Install:
```
yarn
```    
Run:
```
yarn start    
```

If you don't use yarn yet, npm will do too.
