# tdo


Tdo is a minimalist hackable to do list, suited for handling a wide range of tasks.
We wanted to declutter the interface and keep it productive, 
and for this reason we built it as simple as possible, yet still allowing deep customization via CSS and Markdown. 


[Open](https://tdo.cxjs.io) tdo in browser (https://tdo.cxjs.io),

Or get it for android by visiting it through Chrome and press 'add to your homescreen'.


## Install & Run
